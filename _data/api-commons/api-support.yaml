  header: I support a handful of ways you can get support across my network of APIs, and research projects. I prefer to keep all information associated with each projects Github repository, but also try and make myself as available as possible via other channels.
  footer: Please remember I am a one person show, and while I work to achieve the highest levels of available, there are times I go heads down on work, and tune out general email & social chatter. Usually if you submit via Github, with the right title, it will grab my attention, if its critical.
