  header: I work to keep all the changes I make to each API self contained within each project repository. I use the Github issues management for organizing my road map, issues, and change log. This is just a static cache of the Github issues for this project.
  footer: I run a job daily that updates this cached list from the Github repository. Any Github issue that I close, and tag as "change log" will show up here on this list, for storage, and then syndication elsewhere.
