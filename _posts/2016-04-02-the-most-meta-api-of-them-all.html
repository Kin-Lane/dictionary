<p>The world of APIs is always changing and the only way I can keep up with it is having an API that allows me to manage all the moving parts in play. This is my API API, which I use to track on all my APIs, as well as those I keep an eye on in space.</p>
<p>Since this API is kind of the focal point of my API stack, I'm going to make sure it is the most up to date, and use as the prototype that I evolve and replicate acrosss all my other APIs.</p>
<p>If there is a specific method you'd like to see, let me know. I'm constantly evolving and improving to better meet my needs, but don't mind making it work for others, if it makes sense.</p>
